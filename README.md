What is this project about and what does it do.
This is the repository where all updates and all files for first assignment of the Scientifc Programming Course MSB1015 will be committed to.
This is an assignment where scientific programming is practised and HTML, JavaSctipt and SPARQL is used in order to aanswer a scientific question 
and access data via a wikidata query.

This is a one person project and nobody else will be able to contrinute to it.

If there is anything unclear about the uploaded files Robin Haerkens can be contact via r.haerkens@student.maastricht.nl

The project is structured in such a way that updates to the code are not directly committed to the master branch but first to a seperate 
branch on Github aslong as they are a work in progress and will only be committed to the master branch once a paart is finished and functional.

Currently the htmljs.html file contains a query that answers the question of which human diseases have the most genes associated with them.
This spits out a list of disease names, wikidata disease tags and genecount per disease

The table still has to be visualized in a box plot that shows each bar as its own disease with the height corresponding to the number of 
genes.
